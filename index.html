<h1>The leaStudios Story</h1>
<p>leaStudios is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to
    take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding
    to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe
    there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication,
    probably more. To join our movement, <a href="#">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
    <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
    This page is part of the sample site for
    <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to
        Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of
    <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
    <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web.

<p>
    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
        Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
    share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.
